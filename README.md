## 📖 Executive Summary
This paper evaluates **South Korea vs. Russia** as locations for a new Walmart manufacturing facility. Using the **Factor Rating Method (FRM)** and supply-chain principles (MRP, forecasting, capacity, scheduling), the analysis weighs **logistics & infrastructure, labor, market potential, and political/economic stability**.  
**Recommendation:** **South Korea**—strong infrastructure, skilled labor aligned with automation, robust market adjacency, and greater stability.

## 🔍 Key Points
- **Framework:** Material Requirements Planning (MRP), forecasting, capacity planning, automated scheduling.
- **FRM Weights (example used):**
  - Logistics & Infrastructure — **30%**
  - Market Potential — **25%**
  - Political/Economic Stability — **25%**
  - Labor Availability & Cost — **20%**
- **Result:** South Korea scores higher on logistics, stability, market potential, and skilled labor; Russia’s lower labor cost doesn’t offset these strategic advantages.
- **Constraints Addressed:** port congestion, customs delays, supplier capacity, urban traffic, logistics costs.
- **Inventory Strategy:** **Pull-led** system with selective **push** for critical/high-demand items to balance responsiveness and availability.
- **Warehousing Strategy:** automation, lean/JIT, cross-docking, and **co-location** with manufacturing to cut lead time and cost.
- **Quality Practices:** **TQM** culture, **Six Sigma** for variance reduction, ongoing training.
